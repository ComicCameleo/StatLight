TODO: javascript error
fix up DialogAssertionMessageMatchMakerTests tests
cleanup DialogAssertionMessageMatchMaker code (maybe make work the old way with the older assemblies? when_something_executing_in_silverlight_throws_up_a_modal_MessageBox)
look at how RunnerFactor is setting up Logger

look into replacing Default testing framework version - also the string file name for the "default" StatLightClientXapNames.Default is BAD

wrap real unit tests around the XapReader

cleanup logger passed into XapReader
