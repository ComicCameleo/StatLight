How to build?
=========================

StatLight build infrastructure is put together with a number of psake tasks [http://code.google.com/p/psake/].


1. start a powershell (or dos cmd) window in this directory
2. run psake - 
    Debug build   ----- execute the build-Debug.bat file and you can check out the artifacts placed in .\src\build...
    Release build ----- execute the build-Full-Release.bat file and you can check out either the artifacts in .\src\build...
		OR - you can check the .\Release... folder for the release build output
